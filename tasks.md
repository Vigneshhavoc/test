1.	Write  Difference between HTTP 1.1 & HTTP 2?
INTRODUCTION  HTTP
•	HTTP It is stands for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol “.
•	 It is used a (load webpages using hypertext links). 
•	It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers.
•	HTTP is an application layer protocol it  designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. 
•	It typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

What is Mean by  HTTP 1.1:
•	It Published on January  1997.  
•	It through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
•	This version is still in use on the web. 
•   Working format is binary protocol
•   It has a line block that blocks all requests behind it until it has all of its resources
•   It use request resources inline for use getting multiple pages
•   It compress that  date  itself

WHAT IS HTTP 2
•	It Published on May 2015. HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
•	It allows to combine multiple requests .
•	HTTP 2 uses binary code for communication instead of the text files that were used by HTTP/1.1. 
•   Working format is binary protocol
•   It allows  one TCP Transmission Control Protocol connect is required 
•   It use Push frame by server. It collects all multiple pages
•   It compress “Hpack” data compress

2.	Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

•	Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
•	These objects are completely different from JavaScript's primitive data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol).
•	Objects are more complex and each object can contain a combination of these primitive data-types and reference data-types.
•	It can be created with a list of optional properties enclosed in curly braces {}. A property is a "key:value" pair, where a key can be any property name value
